# Sum vs target

  # Target Sum
  #
  # You are given a list of numbers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S.
  #
  # numbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 5], target -> 10  true
  # numbers = [1, 2, 3, 7, 5], target -> 10  true
  # numbers = [1, 2, 3, 7, 5], target -> 8   true
  # numbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 15], target -> 10 false
  #
  # We need to determine if there is a pair of numbers that added together result in the given target
  #
  #Â Iteration 1: assume that numbers array comes already sorted. How would you improve it?
  #Â Iteration 2: assume that numbers array comes unsorted. How would you make it performant?
